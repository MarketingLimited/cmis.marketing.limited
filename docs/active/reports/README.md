# Refactoring Reports

This directory contains comprehensive refactoring reports generated by the `laravel-refactor-specialist` Claude AI agent.

## Purpose

When the Laravel refactoring agent modularizes monolithic code, it generates detailed reports documenting:
- Discovery phase metrics (before state)
- Refactoring strategy and patterns applied
- Before/after comparison with improvement metrics
- Test coverage verification
- CMIS-specific compliance checks
- Risk assessment and deployment recommendations

## Report Naming Convention

Reports follow this naming pattern:
```
refactoring-YYYY-MM-DD-ClassName.md
```

**Examples:**
- `refactoring-2025-11-18-UserController.md`
- `refactoring-2025-11-19-CampaignService.md`

## Report Structure

Each report includes:
1. **Discovery Phase** - Initial metrics and code smell identification
2. **Refactoring Strategy** - Patterns applied and architectural decisions
3. **Before & After Comparison** - Code snippets and metric improvements
4. **Test Coverage** - Test execution logs and new tests added
5. **CMIS Considerations** - Multi-tenancy compliance verification
6. **Risk Assessment** - Deployment safety and rollback plans
7. **Commit History** - All refactoring commits made
8. **Next Steps** - Future refactoring opportunities

## Usage

These reports serve multiple purposes:
- **Documentation** - Historical record of refactoring work
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Team learning resource
- **Code Review** - Supporting material for PR reviews
- **Impact Measurement** - Quantifiable proof of code quality improvements
- **Compliance Audit** - CMIS multi-tenancy pattern verification

## Retention Policy

Reports should be:
- ✅ Kept indefinitely as historical documentation
- ✅ Referenced in pull request descriptions
- ✅ Reviewed during retrospectives
- ✅ Used as templates for future refactoring work
