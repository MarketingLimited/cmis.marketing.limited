# CMIS Historical Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from CMIS development phases, sessions, progress reports, and audits.

## Purpose

Historical documentation is preserved here for reference and context but represents completed work. For current documentation, see the main [docs README](../README.md).

## Archive Structure

### Phase Completion Reports

Documentation organized by development phase:

- **[Phase 0](phases/phase-0/)** - Initial setup and planning phase
- **[Phase 1](phases/phase-1/)** - Foundation and core infrastructure
- **[Phase 2](phases/phase-2/)** - Core feature implementation
- **[Phase 3](phases/phase-3/)** - Advanced features and integrations
- **[Phase 4](phases/phase-4/)** - Platform integrations and optimization
- **[Phase 5](phases/phase-5/)** - Final optimization and completion

### Session Reports

**Location:** `sessions/`

Contains detailed session reports, implementation summaries, and session-specific completion documentation.

## What's Archived vs. Current

### Archived (Historical)
- Completed phase reports
- Past session summaries
- Historical progress tracking (e.g., "64% complete", "85% complete")
- Initial audits and analyses
- Implementation completion reports from specific dates

### Current (Main Docs)
- Active feature documentation
- Current API documentation
- Development guides
- Deployment procedures
- Architecture documentation
- Current analysis and action plans

## Using Historical Documentation

Historical documentation is useful for:

1. **Understanding Evolution** - See how CMIS evolved over time
2. **Decision Context** - Understand why certain decisions were made
3. **Progress Tracking** - Review project history and milestones
4. **Onboarding** - New team members can see the project journey
5. **Reference** - Look up specific implementation details from past phases

---

## Archive Maintenance

### When to Archive

Documents should be archived when:
- They represent completed phases or sessions
- They contain dated progress reports
- They're superseded by current documentation
- They're historical analysis rather than current reference

### When to Keep Current

Documents should stay in main docs when:
- They're actively used for development
- They contain current procedures or guides
- They're reference documentation for active features
- They represent current state or future plans
